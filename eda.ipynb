The side by side boxplot shows that All Star Players do earn much more than those who aren't. However, there are a lot of non All Star players as outliers who make about the same as All Star players. This is because All Star nominations are extremely selective, as there is only a certain amount of players each year who can be selected.

    "It seems like point guards on average are paid more than their peers. This makes sense, because usually the point guards are the players managing a team's offense. Oftentimes, team offenses are largely structured around the play of their pointguards. Due to their importance to teams, it does make sense that they are paid more on average than other positions. All other positions are on average paid around the same at around $12 million. "
