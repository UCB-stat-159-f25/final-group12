    "This project analyzes the factors that determine NBA player salaries during the 2024-2025 season, investigating how statistics, age, and position influence compensation. We focus particularly on the extreme salary disparity caused by superstar players who earn vastly more than average players. To understand which performance metrics teams value most, we compare traditional box score statistics against advanced all-in-one metrics. Our analysis employs multiple modeling approaches including Ordinary Least Squares regression as a baseline, Ridge and LASSO regression to handle correlated predictors, and Random Forest to capture non-linear patterns. By combining regularized linear models with ensemble methods, we provide a comprehensive examination of salary determinants in professional basketball. Ultimately, this research aims to reveal what truly drives NBA salary decisions and whether teams prioritize traditional stats or advanced analytics when compensating players."

    "Below is a snapshot of what our data looks like. As you can see, each player is assigned to a record where the player's game statistics and salaries are recorded. The features that we look at are a mix of traditional box score statistics (Games Played, Field Goals, etc.) in addition to advanced all-in-one metrics (PER, VORP, etc.). All the data is scraped from Basketball-Reference, a third-party site that houses NBA statistics across several seasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also perform some feature engineering to extract binary features based on various NBA Awards and whether a player is in their \"Contract Year\". A \"Contract Year\" means that a player is in the final year of their contract, therefore, the player will be motivated to play to the best of their ability to prove to the franchise that they are worthy of a new contract."
